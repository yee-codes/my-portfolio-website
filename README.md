## Notes Regarding Sitemap
The sitemap above was created during the design phase of the project, the website developed is slightly different from the layout represented by the sitemap.

Instead of having one HTML file/page for education, work experience, skills, hobbies and résumé, I have decided to combine education, work experience, hobbies and résumé into one page under "About Me". In addition, I thought it would be a better idea for skills to have a standalone page to highlight my technical skills. Hence, I added another item under "Home" named "Technical Skills".
