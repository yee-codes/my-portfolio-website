    <p>"They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris," chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.</p>
    <p>"Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?" inquired the duchess.</p>
    <p>"They go to America," murmured Lord Henry.</p>
    <p>Sir Thomas frowned. "I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country," he said to Lady Agatha. "I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it."</p>
    <p>"But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?" asked Mr. Erskine plaintively. "I don't feel up to the journey."</p>
    <p>Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans."</p>
    <p>"How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry. "I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect."</p>
    <p>"I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.</p>
    <p>"I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.</p>
    <p>"Paradoxes are all very well in their way...." rejoined the baronet.</p>
    <p>"Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine. "I did not think so. Perhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them."</p>
