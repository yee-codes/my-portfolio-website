            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.</p>
            <p>I'm a Junior Web Developer, excited to embark on a six-month coding bootcamp at Coder Academy.</p>
            <p>I'm currently located in sunny Sydney, originally from Borneo and having lived in New Zealand for almost 10 years.</p>
            <p>Before becoming a dev, I had a successful and rewarding career in the accounting and banking 
                industry in both New Zealand and Australia.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading and spending time outdoors such as going on a hike or hanging out at the beach. I''m also an enthuasiastic home cook and foodie.</p>
