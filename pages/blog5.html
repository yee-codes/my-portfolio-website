            <p>He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."</p>
            <p>"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."</p>
            <p>"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"</p>
            <p>"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."</p>
            <p>"How did you trace it, then?"</p>
            <p>He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.</p>
            <p>"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,' instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."</p>
            <p>"Texas, I think."</p>
            <p>"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."</p>
            <p>"What then?"</p>
            <p>"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque 'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."</p>
